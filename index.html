            <!-- Another note about canvases... I wonder if I can render to a 1024px^2 canvas but then scale it separately based on window size. That'd ensure I'm always using a sensible pixel IFOV that is fixed for the render, and then that can be displayed by the browser however it needs to at whatever resolution. Want to actually SEE the enlarged pixels for instance. -->
